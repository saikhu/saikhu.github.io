Greetings,

  Welcome to my personal academic portfolio. I hail from `Punjab, Pakistan`, a region renowned for its rich history and cultural heritage. My academic journey commenced at `COMSATS University, Islamabad`, where I earned my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Subsequent to my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, I was honored to receive the Young Student Scholars Scholarship for postgraduate studies at `Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea`. My scholarly pursuits led me to complete my Master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University.
