Greetings,

Welcome to my personal academic portfolio. I hail from Punjab, Pakistan, a region renowned for its rich history and cultural heritage. My academic journey commenced at COMSATS University, Islamabad, where I earned my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering.

Subsequent to my undergraduate studies in Computer Science, I was honored to receive the Young Student Scholars Scholarship for postgraduate studies at Chung-Ang University, Seoul, Korea. My scholarly pursuits led me to complete my Master's degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chung-Ang University.

For any further queries or academic collaborations, please feel free to contact me.
